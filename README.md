Performance Monitnoring SSAS Tabular.
This material is from my presentaion at PASSWIT virtual chapter on 12/05/2018.
Sample code provided has to change a little bit to work on your machine.
The Performance_Monitoring SQL database provided here is only an example. It has some sample data in it.
It is in no way or form ready for a production environment.
You have to create an ExtendedEvents trace and point the Queries view to the folder before it can be used.
